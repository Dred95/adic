ADIC CHANGELOG

Version 2.0.1 (?)

Framework
- Added overloads by generics and type instance for ToFactory() binding method.

Commander extension
- Added System.IDisposable interface to the CommandDispatcher so it can release commands when the scene is destroyed.

- Fixed dispose of commands that implemented System.IDisposable.
- Fixed release of commands that implemented Adic.IUpdatable.
- Now the Commander extension always depends on the Event Caller extension.

Event Caller extension
- Added evaluation of important disposable objects (IInjectorContainer and CommandDispatcher) during registration to avoid the need for following a specific order when registering extensions.
- Fixed adding duplicate objects in disposable/updateable lists.
