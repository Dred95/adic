ADIC CHANGELOG

Version 2.0.1 (?)

Commander extension
- Added System.IDisposable interface to the CommandDispatcher so it can release commands when the scene is destroyed.
- Fixed problem that prevented commands that implemented System.IDisposable to actually be disposed.
- Removed Dispose() method from Adic.Command. To make commands disposable, implement System.IDisposable.
- Now the Commander extension always depends on the EventCaller extension.

Event Caller extension
- Added evaluation of important disposable objects (IInjectorContainer and CommandDispatcher) during registration to avoid the need for following a specific order when registering extensions.
- Fixed problem in which objects were being added twice in the disposable/updateable lists.
