Version 2.3 (2015-?-?)

Commander extension

Version 2.2 (2015-03-21)

Bindings Printer Extension

Version 2.1 (2015-03-12)

Framework
- Added overloads by generics and type instance at IBindingFactory.ToFactory().

Commander extension
- Added interfaces to define command dispatchers (ICommandDispatcher) and command pools (ICommandPool).
- Added System.IDisposable interface to the CommandDispatcher so it can release commands when the scene is destroyed.
- Removed Dispose() method from Adic.Command. To make commands disposable, implement System.IDisposable.
- Fixed dispose of commands that implemented System.IDisposable.
- Fixed release of commands that implemented Adic.IUpdatable.
- Now the Commander extension always depends on the Event Caller extension.

Event Caller extension
- Added evaluation of important disposable objects (IInjectorContainer and ICommandDispatcher) during registration to avoid the need for following a specific order when registering extensions.
- Fixed adding duplicate objects in disposable/updateable lists.
